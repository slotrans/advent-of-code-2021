# Advent of Code 2021

SPOILER WARNING: I tend to leave the answers as comments in the code

## Kotlin

Kotlin solutions are in a standard Java-style project, separate from my preferred simple layout, just because IntelliJ wants it that way.
Using Kotlin 1.6.0 and JDK 11 or 17 depending on the phase of the moon.

## Python

Python solutions are tested with 3.9 or 3.7 depending on where I am on this chart on any given day https://xkcd.com/1987/

## Pascal(!)

Pascal solutions are written and tested in Turbo Pascal 7.0 running in DOSBox. Yes, I am serious.
If I stick it out with Pascal for the harder problems I will probably switch to FreePascal at some point just for ergonomics.
